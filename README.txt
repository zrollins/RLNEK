>=Java 1.8.0_301 [64-bit]
>=Trackmate v7.4.0

Python (pip/conda) instructions:
1. Open terminal/command line
2. Navigate to folder with Trackmate csv files (i.e. cd /pathway/to/trackmate/csv/files)
3. Run Module script (e.g., python3 -m rlnek.Module_1)
4. Input relevant information to the RLNEK prompt (see RLNEK_tests)
5. RLNEK outputs graphs/csvs to current directory 

RLNEK Modules:
Module 0A - convert flow rate to applied tether/tensile force
Module 0B - determine non-specific bond lifetime
Module 0C - determine if coating concentration/site density range meets single-molecule criteria
Module 1 - determine Nb/NT & koff @ various flow rates, coating concentrations
NT Optimization - optimize NT values for given flow rate across various site densities (precursor to Module 2)
Module 2 - determine Nb/NT, koff, k+, & kin @ various flow rates, site densities

Tips:
1. Please read manuscript and corresponding User Guide to understand experimental parameters and data necessary to perform calculations.
2. In previous versions of Trackmate, the files are outputted in different formats. Ensure that Trackmate "tracks" and "spots" files are formatted correctly (e.g., in the "spots" file, particleIDS are listed in numerical order of trackIDs & numerical order of frames). Use provided test files as a reference.
3. All modules can handle replicates for a given condition. Please see test folders for implementation.
4. Collect Receptor-Ligand Non-Equilibrium Kinetics.
5. Use the Jupyter Notebooks versions for additional commented code, stepwise execution, and versatile parameter adjustment.
6. Trackmate user guide available in RLNEK_tests folder
7. Batch process videos with provided ImageJ script

Appendix:
Nb = number of cells/spheres bound
NT = total number of cells/spheres to cross field of view
Nb/NT = capture efficiency
koff = force-dependent dissociation rate (1/ bond lifetime)
k+ = effective on rate of cell/spheres (includes diffusive & kinetic timescales)
kin = intrinsic on rate of receptor-ligand pair (assumed constant)
